GEM_fit: Program to calculate GEM Hermites and multipoles with either
         a numerical or analytical fit from a Gaussian formatted checkpoint
         file.

To install:

after uncompressing go into the main directory (GEM_fit) and:

-modify "setup" and "setup.profile" so that it points to the correct
directory

-source the corresponding file (setup for tcsh, setup.profile for bash)

-modify "config.mak" to choose compiler, either ifort or gfortran. 

-modify "config.mak" to change location for BLAS and LAPACK, note that
 the program will not generate any executable if it cannot link to both.

-make

After making you should see three executables: "GEM_fit, GEM_calc_coefs,
GEM_site_site and GEM_site_site2". The first is for the numerical fitting,
the second for analytical fitting and the last two to calculate intermolecular
interactions with the hermites or multipoles.
______________________________________________________________________________

There is a testing directory: GEM_fit_TEST;

To run the numerical fit, go to the directory and run: 
$GEMNF_HOME/GEM_fit -control input.control. 

For the analytical fit the command is:
$GEMNF_HOME/GEM_calc_coefs -control input.control. 
NOTE: you need to change the name in the "head" option (see below) so that
      you don't overwrite the Hermite and multipoles.

The control file tells the program the names of the files and variable values.

______________________________________________________________________________
The files needed include: 

*.crd: coordinate file in GEM format, has to match the Gaussian input file

*.prm: parameter file, defines auxiliary basis, orbital basis, nuclear charges,
       and local frames. The local frame definition for this example is exactly
       the same as TINKER

*.aux: database of auxiliary functions

*.bas: database of atomic orbital basis (AOs), if you change the basis set
       in your g09 calculation you should check that the basis match (gfprint
       option in gaussian).

*.fchk: formatted checkpoint file from Gaussian. NOTE: the density should
        be generated with the following options: "nosymm 6d 10f"
        This is to ensure that the molecule is not re--oriented and g09 uses
        cartesian orbitals only.

Options for fitting:

cart: should always be on

print: print cubes to file, useful if you don't want to calculate cubes every
       time, only used for numerical fitting

head "filename": this gives the name for the output files

sphere: default for GEM_fit, only used for numerical fit to use spherical grids.

HLYfit: only for numerical fit, use smooth cutoff for discarding points.
        I recommend it on all the time.

GEMESP: If cubegen is not available, this flag will allow GEM to calculate
        the ESP with internal routines (This is much slower than cubegen).

grdsize #: size of spherical grid, options go from extra coarse (1) to
           extra fine (5). In addition, you can select a larger or smaller
           grid by uncommenting "radnum" (number of radial points) and
           "angnum" (number of angular points).

type: Only used for analytical fit: What operator to use for the metric
      (Overlap, Coulomb or Damped Coulomb). Coulomb is default and the
      recommended option. Damped Coulomb is only necessary for very 
      noisy fits.

beta: Only used for analytical fit: this is the parameter for the damped
      coulomb operator, NOTE: "type" has to be set to "D"

scale #: This parameter is used for both fits and determines the Lambda
         for the Tickonov regularization. This is the parameter that is
         optimized to get the most accurate intermolecular Coulomb from the
         GEM hermites (filename.lherm) compared to full QM.

After running you will see some data dumped on the screen including 
fitting details from the control file, electron charges after the fit,
total dipoles and ESP at the origin. In addition, several files will be
generated:

(filename refers to the name chosen for the output files, "test_GEMFIT"
in the example) 

filename.lhermite: Hermite coefficients in local frame.

filename.mpoles_NEW: GEM--DM in local frame for use with GEM_site_site*

filename.mpoles.TINK: GEM--DM in local frame for TINKER, this file is
                      the input for poleditGEM

In addition, for the numerical fit five more files are written:

grd_pts.xyz and grd_pts2.xyz: these files have the cartesian coordinates
                              (and weights) for the spherical grids. If they
                              are not available the program will generate
                              them based on the "size". If they are available
                              they will be read in.

sphere_ESP.cube: ESP evaluated at each point on the grid. The number of lines
                 on this file must match the above two files.

GEM.cubeGmat and GEM.cubeJvec: These are intermediate files for GEM (G matrix
                               and J vector). They are matched to the current
                               grid, AO basis and ABS. They are written out
                               to save time to avoid having to calculate them
                               every time when the "scale" (Tickonov lambda)
                               is being optimized. NOTE: if you change the
                               grid size, fchk file (density), orbitals,
                               ABS, etc. you need to recalculate these.

Once the outputs are generated you can test by calculating the intermolecular
Coulomb interaction by executing:

$GEMNF_HOME/GEM_site_site -crd dimer.crd -lherm test_GEMFIT.lhermite -aux input.aux -parm inputA2.prm

This will run the calculation using the GEM Hermites. The results for the
example are in: "OUTPUT_GEM_site_site_Hermite" and you should get an energy
around -9.17657900512190 kcal/mol

To compare with GEM--DM use:

$GEMNF_HOME/GEM_site_site -crd dimer.crd -lherm test_GEMFIT.mpoles_NEW -aux input.aux -parm inputMP.prm

This will run the calculation using the GEM--DM. The results for the
example are in: "OUTPUT_GEM_site_site_GEM-DM" and you should get an energy
around -6.31012287773050 kcal/mol (Note the -3 kcal/mol difference, from
the penetration error)
